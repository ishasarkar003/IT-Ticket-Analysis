# IT-Ticket-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing over 97,000 real-world IT support tickets (2016–2022) using Microsoft Excel to uncover trends, identify bottlenecks, and provide actionable recommendations for IT operations.

The goal was not just to visualize data, but to solve real business challenges such as:
-Improving resolution times
-Enhancing employee satisfaction
-Optimizing agent performance
-Identifying and addressing process inefficiencies.

Key Insights:
-60%+ of users rated support 5/5 → strong service delivery overall.
-A few agents showed high resolution times & low satisfaction, signaling need for targeted training.
-System & Login Access requests are growing rapidly → potential for automation.
-Employees aged 30–50 report lower satisfaction and longer wait times → support gap to address.
-Ticket prioritization mismatches (e.g., Normal–Low Priority) → slowing down resolution unnecessarily.

Dashboard Features:
-Interactive Pivot Tables – summarize tickets by category, severity, and priority.
-Agent Performance Matrix – highlights satisfaction vs. resolution time.
-Age Group Analysis – compare employee satisfaction across demographics.
-Conditional Formatting – flags overdue & high-severity tickets.
-Trend Analysis – resolution times and ticket volumes over time.
-Satisfaction Score Distribution – identify weak service points.
